# Linear Regression


This personal project aims to investigate the impact of various factors on the rate of new cancer incidents using linear regression in Python. Specifically, I'm examining the relationships between cancer incidence and factors such as median income, poverty rate, education level, age, gender, and smoking rates.

After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I split it into training and testing sets. A linear regression model was then built using the training data and evaluated using metrics like R-squared and mean squared error. To visualize the model's performance, I created scatter plots to compare predicted and actual cancer incidence rates."

By incorporating these suggestions, you can provide a more comprehensive and informative description of your linear regression project.


In line 156 of the code the findings are displayed. The negative values indicate a negative correlation with cancer incident rates and postive values indicate a positive correlation with incident rate for instance as  povertyPercent is postive this indicates areas with higher poverty rates are likley to have a higher cancer incident rate.
